# MohawkChatbot

This is a chatbot prototype that was made during the Mohawk College Hackathon. It aims to provide a prototype of how LLMs can be used to improve student campus life by creating better chatbots.

This prototype uses OpenAI's API to create a chatbot specifically targeting questions related to the college services and events.

A deployment of this project can be found [here](https://chatbot-mohawk.onrender.com). Because this uses OpenAI API there is a small charge to using the program

### NOTE: this is just a prototype.
